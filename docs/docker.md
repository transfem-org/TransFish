# üê≥ Running a Firefish server with Docker

## Pre-built docker container
[registry.joinfirefish.org/firefish/firefish](https://git.joinfirefish.org/firefish/firefish/container_registry)

## `docker-compose`

There is a `docker-compose.yml` in the root of the project that you can use to build the container from source

- .config/docker.env (**db config settings**)
- .config/default.yml (**firefish server settings**)

## Configuring

Rename the files:

`cp .config/example.yml .config/default.yml`

`cp .config/example.env .config/docker.env`

then edit them according to your environment.
You can configure `docker.env` with anything you like, but you will have to pay attention to the `default.yml` file:
- `url` should be set to the URL you will be hosting the web interface for the server at.
- `host`, `db`, `user`, `pass` will have to be configured in the `PostgreSQL configuration` section - `host` is the name of the postgres container (eg: *firefish_db_1*), and the others should match your `docker.env`.
- `host`will need to be configured in the *Redis configuration* section - it is the name of the redis container (eg: *firefish_redis_1*)
- `auth` will need to be configured in the *Sonic* section - cannot be the default `SecretPassword`

Everything else can be left as-is.

## Running docker-compose

The [prebuilt container for firefish](https://git.joinfirefish.org/firefish/firefish/container_registry) is fairly large, and may take a few minutes to download and extract using docker.

Copy `docker-compose.yml` and the `config/` to a directory, then run the **docker-compose** command:
`docker-compose up -d`.

NOTE: This will take some time to come fully online, even after download and extracting the container images, and it may emit some error messages before completing successfully. Specifically, the `db` container needs to initialize and so isn't available to the `web` container right away. Only once the `db` container comes online does the `web` container start building and initializing the firefish tables.

Once the server is up you can use a web browser to access the web interface at `http://serverip:3000` (where `serverip` is the IP of the server you are running the firefish server on).

## Docker for development

```sh
cd dev/
docker-compose build
docker-compose run --rm web pnpm run init
docker-compose up -d
```
