# Reporting Security Issues

## Minor Security Issues

If you discover a minor security issue in Firefish, please report it by sending an
email to [kainoa@t1c.dev](mailto:kainoa@t1c.dev).

## High Security Issues

If you discover a security issue, which is so high risk, that too much is affected by it, please dont send it over unencrypted communication. You can share your PGP keys with us using kainoa@t1c.dev and after we established a secure communication, send it over E-Mail, or message us using matrix' encrypted private messages at @t1c:matrix.fedibird.com or @cleo:tchncs.de


This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the Codeberg repository.

Thanks for helping make Firefish safe for everyone.
